# Cifar10-Hyperopt

This was a homework for the Deep Learning course VITMAV45 of Budapest University of Technology and Economics.  
The task was to use an automatic hyperparameter optimizer package to optimize a simple convolutional model's performance of image classification on the CIFAR10 dataset, and to plot the results, and draw a conclusion.  

I used the Keras-Tuner package.

The results and the code can be seen and read in the <a href="https://github.com/darkpanther99/Cifar10-Hyperopt/blob/main/Hyperopt_task.ipynb">.ipynb file</a>, which can also be ran in a Jupyter Notebook interface(e.g. Google Colab) if wanted.
